# Update FAQs, Help, Guide, and About Pages

Use this prompt when the user-facing documentation needs refreshing after feature changes or to improve content quality.

## Files to Update

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `web/public/faqs.toml` | FAQ content (read directly by browser) |
| `web/public/guide.html` | Step-by-step user guide with screenshots |
| `web/public/about.html` | Marketing/landing page with feature highlights |
| `web/public/images/guide/*.png` | Screenshots used in guide and about pages |

## Terminology Requirements

**All field names and terms MUST follow** `_developers/reference/UK-Government-Form-Field-Standards-Guide.md`:

| Correct Term | Do NOT Use |
|--------------|------------|
| VAT registration number | VRN, VAT number, VAT ID |
| VAT return | VAT submission (when referring to the form) |
| Box 1, Box 2, etc. | Field 1, Item 1 |
| VAT period | Tax period, return period |
| Making Tax Digital | MTD (spell out on first use) |
| Government Gateway | HMRC login, tax login |

## Content Focus

**Primary focus**: VAT return submission workflow
- Entering the 9 boxes
- Understanding obligations (open vs fulfilled)
- Successful submission and receipts
- Viewing previously submitted returns

**Secondary focus**: Setup and troubleshooting
- Bundles (brief - just explain what they are)
- HMRC authorisation flow
- Common errors and solutions

**De-emphasize**:
- Technical details users don't need
- Internal implementation details
- Developer/sandbox features (unless clearly labelled)

## Screenshot Selection

### Source Location
Screenshots are generated by behaviour tests:
```
target/behaviour-test-results/screenshots/submitVat-behaviour-test/
```

### Key Screenshots to Use

| Screenshot Pattern | Shows | Use For |
|-------------------|-------|---------|
| `*-fill-in-vat-*.png` | VAT form with all 9 boxes filled | Guide: submission form |
| `*-complete-vat-receipt.png` | Success message with HMRC reference | Guide/About: submission success |
| `*-obligations-results.png` | Obligations table with periods | Guide: checking obligations |
| `*-view-vat-return-results.png` | Retrieved VAT return details | Guide: viewing submissions |

### Screenshot Best Practices
1. Choose screenshots that show **completed states** (forms filled, results displayed)
2. Avoid screenshots showing loading states or partial content
3. Prefer screenshots without developer options visible
4. Ensure dates/numbers in screenshots are realistic examples

### Copying Screenshots
```bash
# Copy selected screenshots to guide images folder
cp target/behaviour-test-results/screenshots/submitVat-behaviour-test/SELECTED_FILE.png \
   web/public/images/guide/descriptive-name.png
```

## FAQ Structure (faqs.toml)

Each FAQ entry requires:
```toml
[[faq]]

category = "connection|submission|bundles|receipts|vat-basics|errors"
question = "User-friendly question ending with ?"
answer = """
Clear, helpful answer using:
- **Bold** for emphasis
- Numbered lists for steps
- Bullet points for options
- Links to HMRC guidance where helpful
"""
keywords = ["search", "terms", "users", "might", "type"]
priority = 1  # Lower = appears higher in default list
```
