- VPC endpoint configuration for private access
- Audit logging and access pattern monitoring
- Data masking and anonymization for non-production

### CloudFront and CDN Security
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule implementation
- Geographic restriction and IP allowlist management
- Origin access control (OAC) validation
- Cache poisoning attack prevention
- SSL/TLS configuration and HSTS enforcement
- Real-time logging and threat detection

### API Gateway and Endpoint Security
- Request validation and input sanitization
- SQL injection and XSS attack prevention
- API versioning security considerations
- Throttling and quotas for abuse prevention
- Request signing and authentication validation
- Response header security configuration

## Monitoring and Incident Response

Implement comprehensive security monitoring:

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Centralized log aggregation and correlation
- Real-time threat detection and alerting
- Automated incident response workflows
- Forensic log preservation and chain of custody
- Compliance reporting and audit trail generation
- Security dashboard and visualization

### Advanced Threat Detection
- Anomaly detection for authentication patterns
- Machine learning-based fraud detection
- Geographic access pattern analysis
- Device fingerprinting and risk scoring
- Behavioral analytics for insider threats
- Integration with threat intelligence feeds

### Vulnerability Management
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- Infrastructure vulnerability assessment
- Penetration testing procedures and schedules
- Bug bounty program setup and management
- Security patch management workflows
- Zero-day vulnerability response procedures

## Implementation Recommendations

Provide specific, actionable security improvements that:

### Immediate Security Wins
- Implement security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- Add rate limiting to all authentication endpoints
- Enable AWS GuardDuty and Security Hub
- Configure CloudTrail for comprehensive audit logging
- Implement secrets rotation for JWT signing keys
- Add input validation and sanitization everywhere

### Progressive Security Enhancements
- Deploy AWS WAF with OWASP top 10 protection
- Implement comprehensive security testing pipeline
- Add fraud detection and risk scoring
- Configure advanced CloudWatch security metrics
- Implement security incident response automation
- Establish security training and awareness programs

### Compliance and Governance
- Document security controls and procedures
- Implement data classification and handling policies
- Establish vendor risk management processes
- Create security incident response playbooks
- Implement regular security assessments
- Maintain compliance evidence and documentation

## Success Criteria

Security hardening must achieve:
- **Zero Critical Vulnerabilities**: No high-risk security issues in production
- **Compliance Readiness**: Documented controls for major compliance frameworks
- **Monitoring Coverage**: 100% visibility into authentication and authorization events
- **Incident Response**: <30 minute mean time to detection for security events
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party security assessment with remediation
- **Developer Security**: Security-first development practices and training

Consider the impact on:
- **User Experience**: Security measures should not significantly impact performance
- **Operational Complexity**: Security tools should integrate seamlessly
- **Cost Management**: Security investments should be proportional to risk
- **Compliance Deadlines**: Implementation should align with regulatory timelines
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Security should not break existing integrations
- **Development Velocity**: Security processes should enable, not hinder, development

Focus on creating a security-first culture while maintaining the serverless architecture's advantages of scalability, cost-effectiveness, and operational simplicity.

> Formatting and style: Defer to the repo’s formatters — ESLint (flat) + Prettier for JS (ESM) and Spotless (Palantir Java Format) for Java. Use npm run formatting / npm run formatting-fix. See README for details.
> Do not apply styles changes to code that you are not otherwise changes and prefer to match the existing local style when applying the style guides would be jarring.
