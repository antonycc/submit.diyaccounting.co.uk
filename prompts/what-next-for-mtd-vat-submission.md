what next for MTD VAT submission
================================

Please examine the contents of the main branch of the repository https://github.com/antonycc/submit.diyaccounting.co.uk/,
consider and state what appear to be the goals of the repository and consider the work to the point of customers being 
able to submit VAT using this system and come up with a plan that resolves any quality, accuracy or completeness issues
that exist today and then closes the gap to be ready for HMRC approval and real customer use (free).
