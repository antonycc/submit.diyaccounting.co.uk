The most common causes are:
1. **Pop-up blocker** - HMRC authentication opens in a new window. Allow pop-ups for submit.diyaccounting.co.uk

question = "The sandbox works but production doesn't - what's wrong?"
answer = """
Sandbox and production use different HMRC environments with separate credentials:
- **Sandbox** uses test credentials (any VRN works)
- **Production** requires your real HMRC Government Gateway login

If sandbox works but production doesn't:
1. Ensure you're using your actual Government Gateway credentials (not test ones)
2. Check your VRN is registered for MTD VAT with HMRC
3. You may need to re-authorise if your HMRC permissions changed

answer = """
A bundle is a saved configuration for a VAT submission. It stores:
- Your VAT Registration Number (VRN)
- Whether to use sandbox or production HMRC
- Your HMRC authorisation

You can have multiple bundles if you submit VAT for multiple businesses. Each bundle is independent - authorising one doesn't affect others.

You cannot edit a bundle's VRN after creation. Instead:
1. Go to **View and edit your bundles**

Yes. Create a separate bundle for each VAT registration:
1. Click **Add Bundle**

The period key identifies your VAT period:

Yes. The Flat Rate Scheme changes how you calculate VAT, not how you submit it.
