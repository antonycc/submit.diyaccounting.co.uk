# Security Detection & Breach Response Uplift Plan

**Document Version**: 1.4
**Created**: 12 January 2026
**Updated**: 17 January 2026
**Owner**: Development Team

---

## Overview

This plan addresses gaps in security detection capabilities to support the 72-hour breach notification commitment in the Privacy Policy. Current capabilities allow post-incident log analysis but lack real-time alerting for most security events.

## Current State Summary

| Capability | Status | Alerting? |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| WAF rate limiting | Active (2000 req/5min/IP) | Metrics only |
| AWS Managed WAF rules (SQLi, XSS) | Active | Metrics only |
| Lambda error alarms | Active | Yes (CloudWatch) |
| Lambda log-based error detection | Active | Yes (CloudWatch) |
| API Gateway 5xx alarms | Active | Yes (CloudWatch) |
| Synthetic health checks | Active | Yes (SNS email) |
| JWT auth failure logging | Active | No alerting |
| CloudTrail (AWS API activity) | Active | No alerting |
| OAuth state parameter | Active | N/A (CSRF protection) |
| HMRC API audit trail | Active | Masked data, 30-day retention |
| DynamoDB access monitoring | Not implemented | N/A |
| GuardDuty (threat detection) | Not implemented | N/A |
| Security Hub | Not implemented | N/A |
| OAuth secret rotation | Not implemented | N/A |

**Key Gap**: Authentication failures, WAF blocks, and unusual access patterns are logged but don't trigger alerts. You'd discover a breach during manual log review, not in real-time.

## Operational Monitoring Schedule

These ongoing tasks should be performed regardless of uplift phase progress:

### Weekly Tasks
| Task | How | What to Look For |
|------|-----|------------------|
| Check CloudWatch alarms | AWS Console > CloudWatch > Alarms | Any in ALARM state |
| Review GuardDuty findings | AWS Console > GuardDuty > Findings | HIGH/MEDIUM severity (if enabled) |
| Monitor auth failures | CloudWatch Logs Insights query (see PRIVACY_DUTIES.md) | Spikes in failed authentications |
| Check WAF sampled requests | AWS Console > WAF > Web ACLs > Sampled requests | Attack patterns, blocked IPs |

### Monthly Tasks
| Task | How | What to Look For |
|------|-----|------------------|
| Review DynamoDB table sizes | AWS Console > DynamoDB > Tables | Unexpected growth |
| Audit IAM access logs | CloudTrail > Event history > Filter by IAM | Unusual admin actions |
| Check OAuth token cleanup | Query DynamoDB for expired tokens | Tokens past expiry still present |
| Review CloudTrail summary | CloudTrail > Event history | Unusual API calls, error codes |

### Quarterly Tasks
| Task | How | What to Look For |
|------|-----|------------------|
| Review privacy policy | Compare web/public/privacy.html vs actual data processing | Discrepancies |
| Test data export script | Run scripts/export-user-data.js with test user | Script works correctly |
| Test data deletion script | Run scripts/delete-user-data.js with test user | Data properly deleted |
| Verify DynamoDB encryption | AWS Console > DynamoDB > Tables > Settings | Encryption at rest enabled |
| Review CORS configuration | Check EdgeStack.java and API Gateway | Origins restricted appropriately |

### Annual Tasks
| Task | How | What to Look For |
|------|-----|------------------|
| Penetration testing | External third-party engagement | Vulnerabilities |
| Disaster recovery test | Run backup restoration procedure | Backups are restorable |
| Security documentation review | Review all security docs | Outdated information |
| OAuth secret rotation | Rotate HMRC client secrets in Secrets Manager | Secrets > 1 year old |

## Phase 0: Critical OAuth Security Fixes (COMPLETED 2026-01-17)

These vulnerabilities were discovered during security review and fixed immediately:

### 0.1 Cognito OAuth State Validation (CSRF Protection)

**Issue**: Cognito OAuth callback received state parameter but never validated it, allowing CSRF attacks.
**Fix**: Added state validation in `web/public/auth/loginWithCognitoCallback.html` matching the HMRC pattern.

### 0.2 Weak State Generation

**Issue**: `login.html` used `Math.random()` which is not cryptographically secure.
**Fix**: Changed to `generateRandomState()` from `crypto-utils.js` using `crypto.randomUUID()`.

### 0.3 State Storage Location

**Issue**: OAuth state stored in `localStorage` (persists across sessions, accessible to all same-origin scripts).
**Fix**: Changed to `sessionStorage` with key `cognito_oauth_state` (single-session, cleared on tab close).

**Files Modified**:
- `web/public/auth/login.html` - Secure state generation, sessionStorage
- `web/public/auth/loginWithCognitoCallback.html` - State validation before token exchange
- `web/public/auth/login-mock-addon.js` - Consistent with main login flow

---

## Phase 1: High Risk, Low Effort

**Timeline**: Can be completed in days
**Estimated Cost**: ~$2-5/month

### 1.1 Authentication Failure Alerting

**Risk Addressed**: Credential stuffing, brute force attacks
**Effort**: Low (CloudWatch metric filter + alarm)

Create CloudWatch metric filter and alarm for authentication failures:

```
Implementation Location: infra/main/java/co/uk/diyaccounting/submit/stacks/ObservabilityStack.java

Metric Filter:
- Log Group: /aws/lambda/{env}-submit-custom-authorizer
- Pattern: { $.level = "ERROR" || $.level = "WARN" }
- Metric: AuthFailures
- Namespace: Submit/Security

Alarm:
- Threshold: >= 10 failures in 5 minutes
- Action: SNS alert topic
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Alarm fires when 10+ auth failures occur in 5 minutes
- [ ] Email notification received within 1 minute of threshold breach
- [ ] Update PRIVACY_DUTIES.md with detection procedure

### 1.2 WAF Block Rate Alerting

**Risk Addressed**: Active attacks (SQLi, XSS, rate limit abuse)
**Effort**: Low (CloudWatch alarm on existing metrics)

```
Implementation Location: infra/main/java/co/uk/diyaccounting/submit/stacks/EdgeStack.java

Alarms to Add:
1. RateLimitRule blocked requests >= 50 in 5 minutes
2. AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet blocked >= 5 in 5 minutes
3. AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet blocked >= 5 in 5 minutes

Action: SNS alert topic
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Alarm fires when WAF block thresholds exceeded
- [ ] Can differentiate between rate limiting and attack signatures
- [ ] Update PRIVACY_DUTIES.md with response procedure

### 1.3 Enable AWS GuardDuty

**Risk Addressed**: Compromised credentials, unusual API patterns, crypto mining
**Effort**: Low (enable service, ~10 lines of CDK)

```
Implementation Location: infra/main/java/co/uk/diyaccounting/submit/stacks/ObservabilityStack.java

Add:
- GuardDuty detector enabled
- SNS notification for HIGH and MEDIUM severity findings
- Optional: S3 malware scanning for any buckets
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] GuardDuty detector active in production
- [ ] HIGH/MEDIUM findings trigger SNS email
- [ ] Document finding types in PRIVACY_DUTIES.md

### 1.4 Log Sanitization Audit

**Risk Addressed**: Token/PII exposure in logs
**Effort**: Low (audit task)

Verify that sensitive data is never logged in plaintext:

```
Audit Checklist:
1. Search CloudWatch Logs for patterns:
   - "Bearer " followed by long strings
   - "access_token"
   - "refresh_token"
   - Email patterns (@)
   - VRN patterns (9 digits)

2. Review logger.js redaction rules
3. Review dataMasking.js patterns
4. Test with sample requests in sandbox
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] No tokens found in CloudWatch Logs
- [x] No unmasked PII in HMRC API audit trail
- [x] Document sanitization patterns in PII_AND_SENSITIVE_DATA.md

**Audit Results (2026-01-17)**:
- Verified via `app/unit-tests/web/test-report-web-test-local.test.js` - "All 5 HMRC API requests have properly masked sensitive fields"
- `app/lib/dataMasking.js` masks: authorization, access_token, refresh_token, password, client_secret, code (OAuth)
- Pattern matching masks any field ending with: password, secret, token
- URL-encoded body masking handles client_secret=UUID and code=hex patterns
- User `sub` is SHA-256 hashed before DynamoDB storage (prevents correlation attacks)

### 1.5 CORS Policy Review (COMPLETED 2026-01-17)

**Risk Addressed**: Cross-site attacks
**Effort**: Low (review task)

```
Review Locations:
1. EdgeStack.java - CloudFront CORS headers
2. ApiStack.java - API Gateway CORS configuration
3. Lambda response headers

Verify:
- Origins restricted to application domain only (not *)
- Credentials not allowed from untrusted origins
- Methods restricted to required verbs only
```

**Review Findings**:
- `EdgeStack.java` lines 296-304 configures CORS via CloudFront ResponseHeadersPolicy
- Current settings:
  - `accessControlAllowOrigins: List.of("*")` - Allows all origins
  - `accessControlAllowCredentials: false` - Credentials NOT allowed (mitigates risk)
  - `accessControlAllowMethods: List.of("GET", "HEAD", "OPTIONS")` - Read-only methods for static content
  - `accessControlAllowHeaders: List.of("*")` - All headers allowed
  - `accessControlMaxAge: 600 seconds` - Reasonable preflight cache

**Risk Assessment**: LOW
- Wildcard origin (`*`) acceptable because:
  1. Credentials explicitly disabled (`accessControlAllowCredentials: false`)
  2. Static content (S3 origin) doesn't contain sensitive data
  3. API routes (`/api/v1/*`) go through API Gateway with its own CORS handling
  4. CloudFront adds security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] CORS origins do not include wildcards for credentialed requests (verified: credentials=false)
- [x] API Gateway CORS matches CloudFront configuration
- [x] Document CORS configuration in security documentation

- Compromised credentials detection
- Account takeover protection
- CloudWatch metrics for risk events
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Cognito advanced security enabled
- [ ] Risk events logged to CloudWatch
- [ ] High-risk sign-ins trigger additional verification

### 2.2 DynamoDB Table Access Alerting

**Risk Addressed**: Bulk data exfiltration, unauthorized access
**Effort**: Medium (CloudTrail data events + metric filters)

```
Implementation:
1. Enable CloudTrail data events for DynamoDB tables:
   - {env}-submit-receipts
   - {env}-submit-bundles
   - {env}-submit-hmrc-api-requests

2. Create metric filter for unusual patterns:
   - Scan operations (full table scans)
   - High volume GetItem from single source
   - Access from unexpected IAM principals

3. Alarm on threshold breach
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] DynamoDB data events logged to CloudTrail
- [ ] Alarm fires on full table scans
- [ ] Alarm fires on > 1000 GetItem in 5 minutes

### 2.3 Failed HMRC API Call Alerting

**Risk Addressed**: Token theft (unusual 401/403 patterns), API abuse
**Effort**: Low (metric filter on existing logs)

```
Implementation Location: Lambda construct or ObservabilityStack

Metric Filter:
- Log Group: /aws/lambda/{env}-submit-hmrc-*
- Pattern: { $.httpResponse.statusCode = 401 || $.httpResponse.statusCode = 403 }
- Threshold: >= 5 in 5 minutes
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Alarm fires on repeated HMRC auth failures
- [ ] Distinguishes between user error and potential token theft

### 2.4 OAuth Nonce Parameter Implementation

**Risk Addressed**: Replay attacks, token injection
**Effort**: Low-Medium (OAuth state already exists)

```
Implementation Locations:
- web/public/lib/auth-url-builder.js (generate nonce)
- app/functions/auth/hmrcTokenPost.js (validate nonce)
- web/public/activities/submitVatCallback.html (verify nonce)

Requirements:
1. Generate cryptographic nonce alongside state parameter
2. Store nonce in sessionStorage (not localStorage)
3. Validate nonce in callback matches generated value
4. Reject tokens if nonce mismatch
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Nonce generated for each OAuth flow
- [ ] Nonce validated on callback
- [ ] Replay attacks blocked (same nonce rejected twice)

### 2.5 OAuth Client Secret Rotation Procedure

**Risk Addressed**: Compromised credentials
**Effort**: Medium (procedure + optional automation)

```
Manual Rotation Procedure:
1. Generate new client secret in HMRC Developer Hub
2. Add new secret to AWS Secrets Manager as new version
3. Update Lambda environment to use new secret ARN
4. Deploy changes
5. Verify production works with new secret
6. Mark old secret version as deprecated in Secrets Manager
7. After 30 days, delete old secret version

Future: Lambda function for automated rotation
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Rotation procedure documented
- [ ] Secret rotation tested in sandbox environment
- [ ] Annual rotation calendar reminder set

### 3.2 Cross-Account/Region Anomaly Detection

**Risk Addressed**: Lateral movement after credential compromise
**Effort**: Medium (CloudTrail + EventBridge rules)

```
Implementation:
1. EventBridge rule for unusual CloudTrail events:
   - API calls from unexpected regions
   - IAM policy changes
   - Security group modifications
   - New access keys created

2. Route to SNS for alerting
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Alert on IAM changes outside normal CI/CD
- [ ] Alert on API calls from non-London regions

### 3.3 Automated IP Blocking Response

**Risk Addressed**: Prolonged attacks after detection
**Effort**: Medium (Lambda + WAF API)

```
Implementation:
1. Lambda triggered by CloudWatch alarm
2. Lambda adds source IP to WAF block list
3. Block expires after configurable period (e.g., 1 hour)
4. Logs action to audit trail
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Automated block triggers on auth failure threshold
- [ ] Block automatically expires
- [ ] Manual override available

### 3.4 Automated Secret Rotation

**Risk Addressed**: Stale credentials, manual rotation errors
**Effort**: Medium (Lambda + Secrets Manager rotation)

```
Implementation:
1. Create rotation Lambda function
2. Configure Secrets Manager automatic rotation
3. Set rotation schedule (e.g., every 90 days)
4. Test rotation in sandbox
5. Enable for production

Note: Requires HMRC to support programmatic secret generation,
or manual step to update HMRC Developer Hub
