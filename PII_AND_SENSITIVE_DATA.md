- Encrypted at rest and in transit
- IAM policies restrict access to Lambda execution roles only

### 5. User VAT Submission Data

**Source**: Web form submissions
**Data Types**:
- VAT registration number
- VAT period identifiers
- VAT return figures (sales, purchases, VAT amounts)
- Submission dates

**Protection**:
- Stored in DynamoDB with encryption at rest

---

## Data Generated Internally

### 1. User Subject Identifiers

**Generated By**: AWS Cognito
**Data Type**: UUID-format subject identifier (sub)

**Protection**:
- **Hashed before DynamoDB storage** using SHA-256 with a salt (`USER_SUB_HASH_SALT`)
- Original `sub` used for Cognito queries, hashed version (`hashedSub`) used for DynamoDB partition keys
- Salt stored in environment variables (`.env.ci`, `.env.prod`)
- Prevents linking user identity across data breaches

### 2. AWS Cognito JWT Tokens

**Generated By**: AWS Cognito User Pool
**Data Types**:
- ID Token (contains user claims: sub, email, username)
- Access Token (for API authorization)
- Refresh Token (for obtaining new tokens)

**Protection**:
- Short-lived (configurable, typically 1 hour for access/ID tokens)
- Verified using AWS Cognito JWT Verifier in custom authorizer
- Transmitted via HTTPS only
- Stored in browser localStorage (client-side, not server-side)

### 3. Session and Correlation Identifiers

**Generated By**: Application request handling
**Data Types**:
- `requestId` - Unique identifier for each Lambda request
- `correlationId` - Identifier for tracing requests across services
- `amznTraceId` - AWS X-Ray trace ID
- `traceparent` - W3C Trace Context header

**Protection**:
- Not considered sensitive (used for logging and tracing only)
- No PII contained in these identifiers
- Logged for debugging and observability

### 4. Bundle Identifiers and Entitlements

**Generated By**: Bundle management service
**Data Types**:
- Bundle IDs (UUIDs)
- Product catalog entries
- Entitlement flags (e.g., VAT submission enabled)

**Protection**:
- Stored in DynamoDB with encryption at rest
- Linked to hashed user subject identifier
- No PII contained (business logic only)

## Storage Locations

### 1. DynamoDB Tables

**Tables**:
- `{env}-submit-bundles` - User bundle entitlements
- `{env}-submit-receipts` - VAT submission receipts
- `{env}-submit-hmrc-api-requests` - Audit trail of HMRC API requests/responses
- `{env}-submit-async-requests` - Asynchronous request tracking
- `{env}-submit-hmrc-vat-*-async-requests` - VAT operation async tracking

**Protection**:
- **Encryption at rest** (AWS managed keys)
- **Sensitive data masking**: Passwords, tokens, secrets automatically masked in `hmrc-api-requests` table (see `app/lib/dataMasking.js`)
- **User sub hashing**: All partition keys use `hashedSub` instead of plaintext `sub`
- **TTL**: Items automatically deleted after 30 days (receipts, API requests)
- **IAM policies**: Least privilege access (Lambda execution roles only)
- **VPC endpoints**: DynamoDB access via private network (no public internet)

**Sensitive Fields Masked**:
- `hmrcTestPassword`
- `Authorization` headers
- `access_token`
- `refresh_token`
- `client_secret`
- Any field matching patterns: `*password`, `*secret`, `*token` (with exceptions for metadata fields)

### 2. CloudWatch Logs

**Log Groups**:
- `/aws/lambda/{env}-submit-*` - Lambda function logs
- `/aws/apigateway/{env}-submit-api` - API Gateway access logs

**Protection**:
- Structured logging with Pino (JSON format)
- **Sensitive data redaction**: Tokens and passwords logged with truncated prefixes only (e.g., "Bearer test-tok...")
- Encrypted at rest
- Retention period: Configurable (typically 30 days for non-prod, longer for prod)
- IAM policies restrict access to operations teams

**Note**: While logging attempts to avoid sensitive data, the new masking layer in DynamoDB provides an additional layer of defense-in-depth.

### 3. AWS Secrets Manager

**Secrets Stored**:
- HMRC client secrets (production and sandbox)
- Future: Database credentials, API keys (if needed)

**Protection**:
- **Encryption at rest** (AWS managed keys, KMS)
- **Encryption in transit** (TLS)
- **Versioning**: Secret rotation support
- **IAM policies**: Least privilege access (Lambda execution roles only)
- **Audit trail**: CloudTrail logs all access attempts

### 4. AWS Cognito User Pool

**Data Stored**:
- Email addresses
- Username
- Password hashes (managed by Cognito, never accessible to application)
- User attributes (sub, email_verified, etc.)

**Protection**:
- **Managed service** (AWS handles encryption, security patches)
- **Password policy enforcement** (complexity requirements)
- **MFA support** (optional, configurable)
- **Account recovery** via email
- **No plaintext passwords** stored anywhere

### 5. S3 Buckets

**Buckets**:
- `{env}-submit-dev-bucket` - Deployment artifacts (Docker images, static files)
- CloudFront logs (if enabled)

**Protection**:
- **Encryption at rest** (S3 managed keys)
- **Block public access** enabled
- **Versioning** enabled for deployment buckets
- **IAM policies**: Least privilege access
- **No PII stored** in S3 buckets

### 6. CloudFront (CDN)

**Data**:
- Static web assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- No PII stored
- Logs may contain IP addresses and user agents

**Protection**:
- **HTTPS only** (HTTP redirected to HTTPS)
- **Encryption in transit** (TLS 1.2+)
- **WAF integration**: Enabled with rate limiting (2000 req/5min/IP) and AWS Managed Rules (SQLi, XSS, known bad inputs)
- **CloudWatch RUM**: Session replay data (opt-in, limited sampling)

---

## Protection Mechanisms

### 1. Encryption

**At Rest**:
- DynamoDB tables: AWS managed encryption keys
- S3 buckets: SSE-S3 (server-side encryption)
- Secrets Manager: KMS encryption
- CloudWatch Logs: Encrypted by default

**In Transit**:
- HTTPS/TLS for all API communication (ALB, API Gateway, CloudFront)
- TLS 1.2+ required
- Certificate management via AWS Certificate Manager

### 2. Data Masking

**Implementation**: `app/lib/dataMasking.js`

**Automatic Masking**: Before persisting HMRC API requests to DynamoDB, sensitive fields are replaced with `***MASKED***`:
- Password fields (e.g., `hmrcTestPassword`, `password`, `userPassword`)
- Authorization headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer token`)
- OAuth tokens (e.g., `access_token`, `refresh_token`)
- Client secrets (e.g., `client_secret`, `clientSecret`)

**Pattern Matching**: The masking function uses both exact field name matches and pattern-based detection (e.g., fields ending in "password", "token", "secret") while maintaining an allowlist for non-sensitive fields like `periodKey` and `tokenInfo`.

### 3. Hashing

**User Subject Hashing**: `app/services/subHasher.js`

- SHA-256 with salt
- Salt stored in `USER_SUB_HASH_SALT` environment variable
- Applied to all DynamoDB writes (partition key)
- Prevents correlation attacks across data breaches

### 4. IAM Policies

**Least Privilege**:
- Lambda execution roles have minimal permissions
- DynamoDB: Read/write access to specific tables only
- Secrets Manager: Read access to specific secret ARNs only
- No wildcard resource access (`Resource: "*"`)

**Separation of Concerns**:
- Environment-specific IAM roles
- Self-destruct Lambda has elevated permissions (stack deletion) but protected by separate execution context

### 5. Network Security

**Private Networking**:
- Lambda functions can be placed in VPC (currently not enabled for performance)
- DynamoDB VPC endpoints available (not currently used)
- No direct internet access required for most operations

**API Gateway**:
- Custom authorizer validates JWT tokens before Lambda invocation
- CORS configured for specific origins only
- Rate limiting and throttling (AWS default limits)

### 6. TTL (Time To Live)

**Automatic Data Cleanup**:
- HMRC API requests: 30 days (TTL in DynamoDB)
- Receipts: Configurable TTL
- Async requests: Short TTL (minutes to hours)
- Self-destruct stack: 8 hours for CI environments
