## 2. Security Incident Response (72-hour notification)

### When a Breach Occurs
1. **Assess impact**: Determine what data was affected and how many users
2. **Contain**: Immediately mitigate the breach (revoke credentials, block access, etc.)
3. **Notify within 72 hours**:
   - **ICO**: Report via https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/
   - **HMRC**: Email SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk if OAuth tokens or HMRC data affected
   - **Affected users**: Email all impacted users with:
     - What happened
     - What data was affected
     - What actions you've taken
     - What users should do (e.g., revoke HMRC authorization, change passwords)
4. **Document**: Keep records of the incident, response, and remediation

### Types of Breaches Requiring Notification
- Unauthorized access to DynamoDB (bundles, receipts)
- Exposed OAuth tokens or HMRC credentials
- AWS credential compromise
- Data exfiltration or ransomware
- Accidental public exposure of user data

## 3. Current Security Detections (What We Can Detect Now)

### 3.1 Detections That Alert Automatically

These trigger CloudWatch Alarms and send notifications to the configured SNS topic:

| Detection | What It Catches | Where to Check | Response |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| **Lambda Error Alarm** | Unhandled exceptions, code failures | CloudWatch Alarms > `{env}-submit-*-errors` | Check Lambda logs for stack trace |
| **Lambda Log Error Alarm** | ERROR/Exception/FATAL in logs | CloudWatch Alarms > `{env}-submit-*-log-errors` | Search logs for error pattern |
| **API Gateway 5xx Alarm** | Backend failures | CloudWatch Alarms > `{env}-submit-api-5xx` | Check API Gateway + Lambda logs |
| **Lambda Throttle Alarm** | Request volume exceeding capacity | CloudWatch Alarms > `{env}-submit-*-throttles` | Potential abuse - check source |
| **Health Check Canary** | Site down / unresponsive | CloudWatch Alarms > `{env}-ops-health-check` | Check CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda |
| **API Check Canary** | API endpoints unresponsive | CloudWatch Alarms > `{env}-ops-api-check` | Check API Gateway, authorizer |

### 3.2 Detections Logged But Not Alerting

These require manual log analysis to discover:

| Detection | Where to Find | Search Pattern | What It Indicates |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Auth Failures** | CloudWatch Logs > `/aws/lambda/{env}-submit-custom-authorizer` | `level = "WARN" OR level = "ERROR"` | Brute force, invalid tokens |
| **WAF Blocks** | CloudWatch Metrics > `AWS/WAFV2` | Metrics: `BlockedRequests` by rule | Active attacks (SQLi, XSS, rate limit) |
| **Unusual AWS API Calls** | CloudTrail > Event History | Filter by `errorCode` or unusual `sourceIPAddress` | Credential compromise |
| **HMRC API Failures** | CloudWatch Logs > `/aws/lambda/{env}-submit-hmrc-*` | `httpResponse.statusCode = 401` or `403` | Token theft, unauthorized access |

### 3.3 How to Investigate Security Events

#### Check Authentication Failures
```bash
# CloudWatch Logs Insights query
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @logStream like /custom-authorizer/
| filter level = "WARN" or level = "ERROR"
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 100
```

#### Check WAF Activity
1. Go to AWS Console > WAF & Shield > Web ACLs
2. Select `{env}-submit-waf`
3. View "Sampled requests" tab for blocked requests
4. Check CloudWatch Metrics for `BlockedRequests` by rule name

#### Check CloudTrail for AWS API Activity
1. Go to AWS Console > CloudTrail > Event history
2. Filter by:
   - Time range of suspected incident
   - Event source (e.g., `dynamodb.amazonaws.com`)
   - Error codes (e.g., `AccessDenied`)
3. Look for unusual patterns:
   - API calls from unexpected IP addresses
   - Unusual IAM principals
   - Failed access attempts

#### Check HMRC API Audit Trail
```bash
# Query DynamoDB hmrc-api-requests table
aws dynamodb scan \
  --table-name {env}-submit-hmrc-api-requests \
  --filter-expression "contains(httpResponse.statusCode, :code)" \
  --expression-attribute-values '{":code":{"N":"401"}}'
```

### 3.4 Gaps in Current Detection (See SECURITY_DETECTION_UPLIFT_PLAN.md)

**Not Currently Alerting**:
- Authentication failure spikes (brute force detection)
- WAF block rate spikes (active attack detection)
- Unusual DynamoDB access patterns (data exfiltration)
- GuardDuty threat detection (not enabled)

**Planned Improvements**: See `SECURITY_DETECTION_UPLIFT_PLAN.md` for phased implementation plan.

## 4. Data Retention Management

### Regular Tasks

#### Every 30 Days
- Review and delete data for closed accounts older than 30 days
- Run: `scripts/cleanup-deleted-accounts.js`
- This removes: user bundles, Cognito profiles, OAuth refresh tokens

#### Every 7 Years
- HMRC receipts: After 7 years, eligible for deletion (UK tax record-keeping requirement)
- Consider: Archive to cold storage (S3 Glacier) after 2 years for cost savings

#### Every 90 Days
- Review CloudWatch log retention policies
- Ensure infrastructure logs not exceeding 90 days unless flagged for investigation

---

## 5. Monitoring and Auditing

### Weekly
- Check CloudWatch alarms for unusual access patterns
- Review GuardDuty findings (if enabled - see SECURITY_DETECTION_UPLIFT_PLAN.md)
- Review authentication failures in custom authorizer logs
- Check WAF sampled requests for attack patterns

### Monthly
- Review DynamoDB table sizes and growth
- Audit IAM access logs for admin actions
- Check for expired OAuth tokens in need of cleanup
- Review CloudTrail for unusual API activity

### Quarterly
- Review and update privacy policy if services/data processing changes
- Test data export and deletion scripts
- Verify encryption at rest for all DynamoDB tables
- Review and update this document

---

## 6. HMRC Compliance

### Ongoing
- **Fraud Prevention Headers**: Ensure all API calls include required Gov-Client-* headers
- **OAuth Token Security**: Never log or expose OAuth tokens; ensure they're encrypted at rest
- **Production Readiness**: Before HMRC approval, verify:
  - Privacy policy URL is live and accessible
  - Terms of use URL is live and accessible
  - Penetration testing completed
  - Fraud prevention headers tested via HMRC Test API

### Annual
- Review and test disaster recovery procedures
- Verify backups and restoration process
- Update security documentation

---

## 7. OAuth Secret Rotation

OAuth client secrets should be rotated regularly (at least annually) to minimize the impact of potential compromise.

### HMRC Client Secret Rotation

1. **Log into HMRC Developer Hub**: https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/
2. **Navigate to your application** and regenerate the client secret
3. **Update AWS Secrets Manager**:
   ```bash
   aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
     --secret-id arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-west-2:ACCOUNT:secret:ENV/submit/hmrc/client_secret \
     --secret-string "NEW_SECRET_VALUE"
   ```
4. **Lambda picks up the new secret** on next cold start
   - Force a cold start by redeploying, or wait for natural instance rotation
   - Verify by checking a test OAuth flow

### Google OAuth Secret Rotation

1. **Log into Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Navigate to**: APIs & Services > Credentials > OAuth 2.0 Client IDs
3. **Create a new client secret** (you can have multiple active)
4. **Update AWS Secrets Manager**:
   ```bash
   aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
     --secret-id arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-west-2:ACCOUNT:secret:ENV/submit/google/client_secret \
     --secret-string "NEW_SECRET_VALUE"
   ```
5. **Redeploy** the IdentityStack to pick up the new secret
6. **Delete the old secret** in Google Cloud Console after verifying new one works

### Rotation Schedule

| Secret | Location | Rotation Frequency | Last Rotated |
|--------|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| HMRC Client Secret | AWS Secrets Manager | Annually | Document here |
| Google Client Secret | AWS Secrets Manager | Annually | Document here |

### Automated Rotation (Future)

See `SECURITY_DETECTION_UPLIFT_PLAN.md` Phase 3.4 for planned AWS Secrets Manager automatic rotation implementation.
