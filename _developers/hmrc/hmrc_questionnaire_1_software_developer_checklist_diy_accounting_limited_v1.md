## Technical Compliance Questions

### Q3: Digital Definition
**Does your software meet the definition of "Digital" as described in VAT Notice 700/22?**

Reference: [VAT Notice 700/22 Section 4.2.1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70022-making-tax-digital-for-vat/vat-notice-70022-making-tax-digital-for-vat#digital-record-keeping)

Answer: `Yes`

### Q4: Manual Keying
**Is there any manual keying permitted in boxes 1-9 of the VAT return?**

Note: Manual element must be removed before a Production application can be approved. See [VAT Notice 700/22 Section 3.2.1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70022-making-tax-digital-for-vat/vat-notice-70022-making-tax-digital-for-vat). The boxes must be populated from the customer's digital record and no manual keying is permitted in the 9 boxes of the VAT return itself.

Answer: `Yes` - This is bridging software. As file-only/bridging software, users enter figures from their digital records. VAT Notice 700/22 Section 4.3 permits this for bridging software.

### Q5: Spreadsheet Import
**Can your product import from a spreadsheet or CSV file?**

Answer: `No`

### Q6: Multiple Source Import
**Can your product import from multiple sources to amalgamate data?**

Answer: `No`

### Q7: Box 5 Negative Amount
**Can box 5 contain a negative amount?**

Note: Box 5 cannot contain a negative amount, the minimum value is 0.00. See VAT documentation for [Submit VAT return for Period](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/vat-api/1.0#_submit-vat-return-for-period_post_accordion). Our systems will identify if the figure is a positive or negative dependent upon which figure (in Box 3 or Box 4) was higher.

Answer: `No`

### Q8: Boxes 6-9 Pence
**Do boxes 6-9 contain pence?**

Note: These fields should contain whole pounds only. If pence is included, this should be to 2 zeroed decimal places.

Answer: `No` - whole pounds only

### Q9: Period Key Visibility ⚠️
**Is the Period Key visible?**

Note: Period Keys should not be shown to the customer, these are for software use to ensure the return is recorded against the correct obligation.

Answer: `Yes` - **NON-COMPLIANT - REQUIRES REMEDIATION**

Current State: The period key is currently visible as a manual text input field on submitVat.html (line 81-83). Users must manually enter the period key (e.g., "24A1").

Remediation Required: Replace manual period key entry with an obligation selection dropdown populated from the VAT Obligations API. The period key should be hidden from users and used internally for submission. See PLAN-9-BOX-VAT-IMPLEMENTATION.md Component 5 (Obligation Selector UI).

### Q10: Legal Declaration ⚠️
**Is the Legal Declaration shown on screen prior to submission of the return?**

Note: It must be shown. Please add prior to data submission if it is missing. A copy of the declaration text can be found in the [VAT (MTD) end-to-end service guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/vat-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/obligations.html#period-keys). Please include a screenshot of the text displayed in your software at the point of submission.

Answer: `No` - **NON-COMPLIANT - REQUIRES REMEDIATION**

Current State: No legal declaration is currently shown on submitVat.html before submission. The form submits directly without requiring user acknowledgment of the declaration.

Remediation Required: Add a mandatory checkbox with the legal declaration text that must be checked before the submit button becomes active. The declaration text is:

> "When you submit this VAT information you are making a legal declaration that the information is true and complete. A false declaration can result in prosecution."

See PLAN-9-BOX-VAT-IMPLEMENTATION.md Component 6 (Submit VAT Form UI) for implementation details.

### Q11: Recent Testing
**Have you conducted testing in the last 2 weeks?**

Note: If not could you please do so as our testing logs are only retained for a 14 day period.

Answer: `Yes`

### Q12: Error Testing
**Have you conducted any error testing?**

Note: Although not mandatory it is beneficial.

Answer: `Yes`

### Q13: UK Standards
**Is your product built to UK standards and conventions (e.g. UK dates, £ not $ etc.)?**

Answer: `Yes`

### Q14: White Label
**Is your product a white label?**

Note: In general, white label branding is a practice in which a product or service is produced by one company and then rebranded by another company to make it appear to be their own.

Answer: `No`

### Q15: GDPR Compliance
**Is your product GDPR compliant?**

Reference: [Terms of Use](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/terms-of-use) - "Storing Data"

Answer: `Yes`

### Q16: WCAG Compliance ⚠️
**Does your product meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (minimum level AA)?**

Reference: [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), [Terms of Use](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/terms-of-use) - "Accessibility"

Answer: `Partial` - **REQUIRES REMEDIATION**

Current State (per COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md dated 19 January 2026):
- Pa11y (WCAG 2.1 AA): ✅ 16/16 pages passed
- axe-core: ❌ 13 violations across pages

axe-core Violations Requiring Remediation:
| Rule | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| document-title | Serious | Some pages missing non-empty `<title>` element |
| link-in-text-block | Serious | Links not distinguished from surrounding text (9 instances) |
| landmark-one-main | Moderate | Document missing main landmark |
| page-has-heading-one | Moderate | Page missing level-one heading |

Remediation Required: Address axe-core violations before production approval. See COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md for full details and PLAN-9-BOX-VAT-IMPLEMENTATION.md Component 4 (CSS/Accessibility) for link styling fixes.

## Compliance Gap Summary

The following items require remediation before HMRC production approval:

| Item | Question | Current State | Remediation |
|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| ⚠️ Q9 | Period Key Visibility | Visible to users | Hide via obligation selector dropdown |
| ⚠️ Q10 | Legal Declaration | Not shown | Add mandatory declaration checkbox |
| ⚠️ Q16 | WCAG Compliance | 13 axe-core violations | Fix document-title, link-in-text-block |

Additionally, the current implementation only collects 1 VAT field (vatDue) rather than the full 9-box return. While bridging software permits manual entry, the current form structure should be enhanced. See PLAN-9-BOX-VAT-IMPLEMENTATION.md for the complete remediation plan.

## Sign-off

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Drafted by | Antony Cartwright, Director |
| Draft Date | 20 January 2026 |
| Status | PRE-PRODUCTION - Pending remediation |
| Any comments | This is bridging software (file-only) that allows users to submit VAT returns from their existing digital records. Current implementation requires remediation of Q9 (period key visibility), Q10 (legal declaration), and Q16 (WCAG compliance) before production approval. See PLAN-9-BOX-VAT-IMPLEMENTATION.md for the implementation roadmap. |
