# Human QA Test Plan — DIY Accounting Submit

## Purpose

Iterative manual QA test sessions. Each section builds on the previous one, giving the tester early wins before progressing to more complex journeys. Start from Section 1 and work through in order.

**Test both mobile and desktop** for every section.
**Monitor the Telegram feed** — every action you take should appear in the live Telegram channel.
**Note any incidents** on the ops Telegram channel and record them.
