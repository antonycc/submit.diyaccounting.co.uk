### What I checked
I reviewed all declared dependencies in your `package.json` and `pom.xml` and looked for:
- Signs of low/paused maintenance, ecosystem shifts, or better-supported alternatives
- Version alignment within each ecosystem (AWS SDKs, CDK, JUnit, Jackson, logging, test tooling)
- Opportunities to simplify or modernize (e.g., built-in Node APIs vs. external packages)

Below are concrete findings, suggestions, and safe upgrade paths. Where I’m not 100% certain on “latest” for a fast-moving package, I’ve included quick commands to verify in your environment before changing.

### Node.js (package.json)

#### Definitely consider removing or replacing
- `node-fetch@^3.3.2`
    - Why: Node 18+ ships a standard `fetch` implementation. You’re on `engines.node >= 22.0.0`, so `fetch` is built-in, standards-compliant, and actively maintained as part of Node. The `node-fetch` project is not deprecated, but is essentially redundant on modern Node and frequently not the most actively maintained piece of the stack.
    - Suggested action:
        - Prefer the built-in `globalThis.fetch` and `Headers/Request/Response`.
        - If you need extra features (agent pooling, retries), consider `undici` (the HTTP client that powers Node’s `fetch`) which is very actively maintained by the Node team.
    - Upgrade/removal path:
        - Replace `import fetch from 'node-fetch'` with the built-in `fetch`.
        - Remove `node-fetch` from `dependencies`.

- `fluent-ffmpeg@^2.1.3`
    - Why: It still works for many, but community activity is sporadic and the project isn’t under very active evolution. When you’re already using `ffmpeg-static`, a simpler, more explicit process-invocation approach can be easier to maintain.
    - Alternatives:
        - Keep `ffmpeg-static` and spawn `ffmpeg` directly via `child_process`/`execa`. This avoids a large wrapper and gives you full control over flags.
        - For programmatic pipelines in Node, consider using `@ffmpeg.wasm/main` (WebAssembly) for pure-JS environments, though it’s heavier and slower than native ffmpeg.
    - Migration tip:
        - Start by replicating your current invocations using `execa('ffmpeg', [args], { stdio: 'inherit' })` and keep `ffmpeg-static` in `PATH` (resolve its binary).

- `winston@^3.18.3`
    - Why: Not deprecated, but the Node logging ecosystem has largely consolidated around `pino` for performance and active maintenance. Winston is still maintained, but has slower iteration and heavier abstractions.
    - Alternative:
        - `pino` (highly active, excellent perf). If you want a batteries-included logger with minimal overhead and good JSON output, pino is the common default now.
    - Migration tip:
        - Start by swapping to `pino` for new code paths; keep `winston` where it is until comfortable, then remove.

#### Likely fine as-is, with routine upgrades
- `@aws-sdk/* v3` (you use `^3.918.0`): AWS JS SDK v3 is modular and very active. Stay on latest compatible minor.
- `dotenv@^17.2.3` and `dotenv-cli@^10.0.0`:
    - Note: The canonical `dotenv` package’s long-lived stable is `16.x`. If you’re indeed on the `dotenv` package (not a scoped fork), double-check that `17.x` is the one you intend to use. If you hit ecosystem friction, `16.x` remains mainstream and very stable.
- `eslint@^9`, `prettier@^3`, `eslint-plugin-*`, `@microsoft/eslint-formatter-sarif`: All current and well-supported; keep them updated.
- `vitest@^4.0.4`, `@vitest/coverage-v8@^4.0.4`:
    - Vitest is very active and healthy. Keep aligned at the same major for core and coverage packages.
- `@playwright/test@^1.56.1` and `msw@^2.11.6`: Actively maintained; keep them current within major.
- `express@^5.1.0`: Express 5 is GA and still the dominant minimal web framework. Not hyper-active but stable and widely supported.
- `ngrok@^4.3.3`, `uuid@^13.0.0`, `testcontainers@^11.7.2`, `aws-sdk-client-mock@^4.1.0`, `happy-dom@^20.0.8`, `supertest@^7.1.4`, `npm-check-updates@^19.1.1`, `@ffprobe-installer/ffprobe@^2.1.2`, `ffmpeg-static@^5.2.0`, `fluent-ffmpeg` (see above), `toml`, `@iarna/toml`, `bcryptjs`: All appear fine; keep them updated as needed.

#### Quick commands to verify and plan upgrades
- Check available updates while respecting your Node engine:
    - `npx npm-check-updates -u --enginesNode --target minor`
    - For a one-shot to the latest: `npx npm-check-updates -u --enginesNode --target greatest --reject 'alpha'`
- Then: `npm install && npm test`

### Java/Maven (pom.xml)

#### Watch-outs and suggestions
- AWS CDK libraries vs CLI
    - In `pom.xml` you use `software.amazon.awscdk:aws-cdk-lib` with `cdk.version=2.221.0`.
    - In `package.json` you use `aws-cdk@^3.0.0` (the CLI). The v3 CLI is designed to continue supporting v2 apps, but it ships some breaking removals and cleans up old feature flags. If you notice CDK synthesis warnings or incompatibilities, consider:
        - Option A: Keep CLI on v3 and continue with `aws-cdk-lib v2` (most common right now). Periodically bump `cdk.version` to the latest v2.
        - Option B: If/when CDK v3 libraries are broadly recommended across languages, plan a coordinated bump (check AWS CDK release notes first). For Java today, v2 remains the mainstream library line.

- `jackson-bom@2.20.0`
    - Note: The widely-used stable line as of late 2024/2025 is around `2.17.x–2.18.x`. `2.20.0` is unusually ahead of what many projects carry. Before adopting, verify it exists for your plugins and aligns with your transitive deps.
    - Safer path today:
        - Pin to the latest stable of the 2.18 line (e.g., `2.18.x`) unless you explicitly need 2.20 features.

- `mockito-core@5.20.0`
    - Mockito 5 is active and stable; Mockito 6 may be available. If you need Java 21 niceties or new features, consider upgrading to the latest 5.x/6.x.

- `org.slf4j:slf4j-simple@2.0.17`
    - SLF4J 2.0.x is the current stable line and is fine. If you need structured logging or bridges to CloudWatch/JSON, you might prefer `logback-classic` or a JSON-capable backend, but `slf4j-simple` is perfectly fine for simple runtime logging.

- `software.constructs:constructs@10.4.2`
    - Correct for AWS CDK v2. If you later move to a different CDK major, revisit the `constructs` major accordingly.

- `com.amazonaws:aws-lambda-java-core@1.4.0`, `aws-lambda-java-events@3.16.1`
    - These are active. Keep them periodically current within their major. Ensure your Lambda runtime and these libraries align with Java 21 bytecode if you deploy compiled artifacts to Lambda.

- `org.apache.httpcomponents.core5:httpcore5@5.3.6`
    - Current and maintained; keep within the 5.3.x line.

- `junit-bom@6.0.0`, `junit-jupiter` artifacts
    - JUnit 6 is the newest major and still evolving. If your plugins and extensions (e.g., Pioneer) align, staying on 6 is reasonable. Otherwise, the latest 5.10.x is extremely mature. You already use `junit-pioneer@2.3.0`, which has JUnit 5/6 support—verify compatibility notes before upgrading further.

- `log4j-bom@2.25.2`
    - The 2.2x line is current and supported. If you’re not using log4j directly (since you route to SLF4J Simple), you could even omit this BOM unless a transitive requires it.

- `software.amazon.awssdk:bom@2.36.2` and services (`cloudformation`, `lambda`, `s3`)
    - AWS Java SDK v2 is very active. Keep the BOM current and drop explicit module versions where you import the BOM (you already do that correctly in depMgmt; you can omit versions on the individual service modules).

#### Quick commands to verify and plan Maven upgrades
- Show available property-based updates (replace placeholders if you use the versions-maven-plugin):
    - `./mvnw versions:display-property-updates -Dincludes=cdk.version,immutables.version`
- Show dependency updates:
    - `./mvnw versions:display-dependency-updates`
- Then bump conservatively:
    - `./mvnw versions:use-latest-releases` (review changes)

### Summary of concrete actions
- Remove `node-fetch` and migrate to built-in `fetch` (Node 22). Consider `undici` for advanced HTTP needs.
- Plan to replace `fluent-ffmpeg` with a simpler direct `ffmpeg` invocation using `ffmpeg-static` + `execa` (or evaluate `@ffmpeg.wasm/main` if native is not an option). Keep if it’s working and you prefer the wrapper, but note maintenance.
- Consider migrating from `winston` to `pino` over time for performance and more active iteration.
- Verify `dotenv@17.x` choice; if you encounter tooling issues, pin to `dotenv@^16.4.x`.
- Keep `@aws-sdk/* v3`, `eslint@^9`, `prettier@^3`, `vitest@^4`, `playwright@^1.56`, `msw@^2`, etc., up to date.
- Maven: stay on AWS SDK v2 BOM and bump routinely; keep CDK lib on v2 and the CLI on v3 (watch release notes). Revisit `jackson-bom` to a widely-used stable (2.18.x) unless you verified 2.20.0 across your toolchain. Optionally bump Mockito to latest 5.x/6.x.

---

### Optional: automated checks you can add to CI
- Node audit and freshness:
    - `npx npm-check-updates --error-level 2 --enginesNode --target minor` to fail CI if minors are behind
    - `npm audit --production` (understand its limitations)
- Java dependency freshness:
    - Add a CI job with `mvn versions:display-dependency-updates` and publish the report as an artifact.
- Security scanning:
    - Use GitHub Advanced Security (Dependabot, code scanning) or `osv-scanner` to catch known issues across both ecosystems.

If you want, I can produce diffs for a minimal PR that removes `node-fetch`, shows a `fetch` replacement, and adds a simple `ffmpeg` invocation using `execa`. Let me know which changes you’d like to apply first.
