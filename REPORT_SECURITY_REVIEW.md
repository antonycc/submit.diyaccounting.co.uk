## ✅ Key Security Strengths

### 1. OAuth 2.0 Implementation: EXCELLENT ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **State validation**: Cryptographically secure with `crypto.randomUUID()`
- **Nonce validation**: Prevents replay attacks
- **Single-use tokens**: Cleared immediately after validation
- **Error handling**: Clear security event logging
- **Assessment**: Textbook-perfect implementation

**File**: `web/public/auth/loginWithCognitoCallback.html`

### 2. Content Security Policy: COMPREHENSIVE ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **CloudFront**: Full CSP implementation in EdgeStack
- **Express Server**: Matching CSP for local development
- **Headers**: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options all present
- **Protection**: Mitigates XSS, clickjacking, MIME confusion

**Files**: 
- `infra/main/java/co/uk/diyaccounting/submit/stacks/EdgeStack.java`
- `app/bin/server.js`

### 3. Secrets Management: EXEMPLARY ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: All credentials stored securely, per-account isolation
- **Account separation**: Each AWS account (submit-ci, submit-prod) has its own Secrets Manager entries and KMS keys -- a compromise in one account cannot access secrets in another
- **Caching**: Proper per-Lambda container caching
- **Rotation**: Documented procedures in runbook
- **No hardcoded secrets**: Zero secrets in code
- **Salt management**: HMAC-SHA256 with environment-specific salt, 3 independent recovery paths (Secrets Manager, physical card, KMS-encrypted DynamoDB item)

**Files**:
- `app/services/subHasher.js`
- `app/functions/hmrc/hmrcTokenPost.js`

### 4. Data Protection: THOROUGH ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **PII masking**: Dual-layer (field names + regex patterns)
- **User ID hashing**: HMAC-SHA256 prevents correlation attacks
- **Data masking**: Comprehensive before DynamoDB persistence
- **Logging redaction**: VRN, UTR, NINO, email, tokens all redacted

**Files**:
- `app/lib/dataMasking.js`
- `app/lib/logger.js`
- `app/services/subHasher.js`

### 5. Input Validation: ROBUST ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **HMRC-specific**: VRN, period keys, VAT amounts validated
- **Format validation**: ISO dates, monetary amounts, whole numbers
- **Range validation**: All VAT boxes within HMRC specifications
- **Calculation validation**: Box 3 = Box 1 + Box 2, etc.

**Files**:
- `app/lib/hmrcValidation.js`
- `app/lib/vatReturnTypes.js`

### 6. JWT Validation: PROPER ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **AWS-maintained library**: `aws-jwt-verify` (CognitoJwtVerifier)
- **Signature verification**: Against Cognito public keys
- **Claim validation**: Expiry, audience, issuer all checked
- **Caching**: Verifier cached across Lambda warm starts

**Files**:
- `app/functions/auth/customAuthorizer.js`
- `app/lib/jwtHelper.js`

### 7. Multi-Account Isolation: STRONG ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **6 AWS accounts**: management (887764105431), gateway (283165661847), spreadsheets (064390746177), submit-ci (367191799875), submit-prod (972912397388), submit-backup (914216784828)
- **Blast radius containment**: CI cannot affect prod (separate accounts, separate IAM, separate service limits)
- **Backup isolation**: Dedicated backup account (914216784828) -- compromised prod cannot delete backups
- **Static site isolation**: Gateway and spreadsheets in separate accounts cannot access submit data
- **Clean management account**: Minimal attack surface -- only Route53, Organizations, IAM Identity Center
- **Per-account OIDC**: Each account's GitHub Actions OIDC trust is scoped to its deploying repository only
- **Per-account secrets and KMS**: Each account has independent Secrets Manager entries and customer-managed KMS keys
- **WAF**: Web Application Firewall deployed per submit account (rate limiting, SQL injection, XSS protection)

### 8. CI/CD Security: SOLID ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **OIDC authentication**: No long-lived AWS credentials in GitHub -- short-lived tokens via OIDC
- **Repository-scoped trust**: Each account trusts only its deploying repository (e.g., submit-prod trusts only `antonycc/submit.diyaccounting.co.uk`)
- **Role chain**: OIDC token -> github-actions-role -> deployment-role -> CloudFormation (least privilege at each step)
- **Cross-account DNS delegation**: `root-route53-record-delegate` IAM role in management account for DNS record creation, scoped to Route53 only

### 9. Data Lifecycle Management: PROPER ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **DynamoDB TTL**: Configured on all relevant tables (28 days for HMRC API requests, 7 years for receipts, 1 hour for async requests)
- **Backup schedules**: Daily (35-day retention), weekly (90-day retention), monthly compliance (7-year retention with cold storage transition)
- **Cross-account backup**: Planned shipping to submit-backup account (914216784828) for ransomware protection
- **PITR**: Planned for critical tables (receipts, bundles, passes, subscriptions)

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What This Application Does Well

1. **Security-First Architecture**: Security considerations built into design from the start
2. **Multi-Account Isolation**: 6 AWS accounts with per-account IAM, OIDC, secrets, and KMS keys -- blast radius containment at the account boundary level
3. **Comprehensive Protection Layers**: Multiple defensive layers (CSP, WAF, validation, masking, account isolation)
4. **Best-Practice OAuth**: Textbook implementation with state + nonce validation
5. **Proper Secrets Management**: Zero hardcoded secrets, per-account AWS Secrets Manager with independent KMS encryption
6. **Thoughtful Data Protection**: User ID hashing prevents correlation attacks across breaches
7. **Production-Ready Monitoring**: Structured logging with PII redaction
8. **CI/CD Security**: OIDC-based deployment (no long-lived credentials), repository-scoped trust per account

### Areas of Excellence

- **Multi-Account Architecture**: 6-account AWS Organization with dedicated backup account, per-account OIDC scoping, and clean management account -- exceeds typical single-account deployments
- **OAuth Implementation**: Could be used as a reference implementation for OAuth 2.0 security
- **Secrets Management**: Exemplary use of AWS Secrets Manager with per-account isolation and proper caching
- **Data Masking**: Dual-layer approach (field names + regex) is thorough
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive CSP and HTTP security headers, WAF on submit accounts
- **Documentation**: Excellent security runbook with operational procedures

## 🔒 Compliance Status

### GDPR/UK GDPR
- ✅ PII masking in logs and storage
- ✅ IP address masking (last octet replaced)
- ✅ Device ID truncation (first 8 chars only)
- ✅ Data subject rights procedures documented
- ✅ 7-year retention for HMRC receipts (legal requirement), enforced by DynamoDB TTL
- ✅ Data residency: all PII in eu-west-2 (submit-prod 972912397388 only)

## 📊 Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Profile
- **Confidentiality**: LOW (per-account secrets isolation, PII masked, encryption at rest with per-account KMS keys)
- **Integrity**: LOW (input validation, HMRC response validation, audit logging, account-level blast radius containment)
- **Availability**: LOW (async processing, proper error handling, TTL cleanup, account-level fault isolation)

### Threat Mitigation
- **XSS**: Mitigated by CSP + WAF (further hardening possible with nonce)
- **CSRF**: Mitigated by OAuth state validation + nonce
- **Injection**: Mitigated by parameterized queries + input validation + WAF SQL injection rules
- **Token Theft**: Partially mitigated by CSP (HTTP-only cookies would improve)
- **Secrets Exposure**: Mitigated by per-account AWS Secrets Manager + per-account KMS keys + no hardcoding
- **Account Compromise**: Mitigated by account isolation (CI/prod/backup in separate accounts, OIDC scoped per repo)
- **Backup Destruction**: Mitigated by dedicated backup account (914216784828) with deny-delete vault policy (cross-account shipping planned)
- **CI/CD Supply Chain**: Mitigated by OIDC (no long-lived credentials), repository-scoped trust policies

## 🎯 Conclusion

This application demonstrates **excellent security practices** and is **ready for production**. The comprehensive implementation of security controls, particularly the textbook-perfect OAuth flow, thorough data protection mechanisms, and multi-account AWS isolation, sets a high standard.

Since the original review (January 2026), the architecture has been significantly strengthened by the completion of AWS account separation (6 accounts) and repository separation (4 repos). Each service now deploys to its own account with independent IAM, OIDC trust, Secrets Manager, and KMS keys. CI/CD uses OIDC with no long-lived credentials, and each account's trust is scoped to its deploying repository only. The remaining infrastructure work is cross-account backup shipping (Phase 3), which will add ransomware-resilient backup isolation.

The remaining recommendations are all enhancements rather than critical fixes. The application has a solid security foundation that can support continued development and scaling.

**Recommendation**: Approve for production deployment.
