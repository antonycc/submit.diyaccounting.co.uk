# Expand Capabilities Prompt

Analyze the current repository and suggest ways to expand its capabilities while maintaining the existing architecture and patterns.

Focus on:
- New features that would enhance user value
- Additional integrations that align with the current tech stack (Node.js, AWS CDK, Lambda)
- Enhanced workflow automation opportunities
- New API endpoints or services that complement existing functionality
- Additional testing capabilities or frameworks
- Security enhancements and monitoring improvements
- Performance optimizations and scalability improvements

Consider the existing patterns:
- AWS serverless architecture (Lambda, S3, CloudFront, API Gateway)
- Express.js server with multi-environment support (.env.ci, .env.prod, .env.proxy)
- Comprehensive testing suite (unit, integration, system, behavior tests)
- GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
- Java CDK infrastructure as code
- VAT submission and accounting features

Provide specific, actionable suggestions that:
- Build upon existing foundations
- Maintain code quality standards
- Are feasible to implement incrementally
- Add meaningful business value
- Follow established architectural patterns
