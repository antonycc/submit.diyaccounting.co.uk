# submit.passes.toml
# Pass type definitions for DIY Accounting Submit
#
# This file defines the templates for generating invite passes.
# It is read by the GitHub Actions generate-pass workflow and the passAdminPost Lambda
# to populate defaults when creating passes. It is NOT validated at runtime when
# passes are persisted or redeemed - the pass record itself is self-contained.
#
# Pass records store their own bundleId, maxUses, validUntil etc. so this file
# can evolve independently without affecting existing passes.
