# PLAN: Fix paymentBehaviour-ci Stripe Checkout Redirect Timeout

## User Assertion
> Investigate and fix "The paymentBehaviour-ci failure (Stripe checkout redirect timeout) needs separate investigation — it's not related to the salt migration."

## Key Finding: This Test Has NEVER Passed in CI

The test was **always failing** but was hidden by missing `pipefail` in the npm test scripts. Commit `27eb5bbf` ("fix: update test scripts to use bash for improved error handling") added `set -o pipefail` to all test scripts, which exposed the pre-existing failure.

### Evidence
- **Run 22044130350** (last "successful" deploy, 2026-02-15): paymentBehaviour-ci job reported `conclusion: success` but logs show `✘ 1 failed` with `(0ms)` — failed instantly because salt was raw string (pre-migration). The `tee` pipe without `pipefail` masked the exit code.
- **Run 22047106611** (fresh deploy with salt migrated, 2026-02-16): paymentBehaviour-ci fails at Stripe checkout redirect timeout. Salt works now, test gets further but Stripe never redirects.

## Fixes Applied (All Committed & Pushed to `nvsubhash`)

### Fix 1: `force: true` on submit button click (commit `46010042`)
**File:** `behaviour-tests/steps/behaviour-bundle-steps.js`

The submit button click was the only Stripe interaction missing `force: true`. Stripe overlays (Link, express checkout, AmazonPay) can absorb clicks. This fixed the proxy test immediately.

### Fix 2: `initializeSalt()` in webhook Lambda (commit `46010042`)
**File:** `app/functions/billing/billingWebhookPost.js`

`billingWebhookPost.js` was the ONLY Lambda handler using `dynamoDbBundleRepository` without calling `initializeSalt()` first. When the webhook received `checkout.session.completed`, it verified the signature successfully but crashed at `putBundleByHashedSub()` with "Salt not initialized. Call initializeSalt() first."

Lambda CloudWatch logs confirmed:
```
Error storing bundle by hashedSub in DynamoDB Salt not initialized. Call initializeSalt() first.
Error processing webhook event  type: checkout.session.completed  error: Salt not initialized
```

The IAM permissions were already correct (BillingStack.java:406 grants `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`). Only the JS code was missing the call.

### Fix 3: 3s delay before submit click (commit `5bd1e961`)
**File:** `behaviour-tests/steps/behaviour-bundle-steps.js`

Added `await page.waitForTimeout(3000)` before submit to let Stripe SPA fully process field inputs. In CI Docker, fields fill in <1 second which may be too fast for Stripe's JS to process.

### Fix 4: Multi-strategy click for submit button (commit `4ca33fbb`)
**File:** `behaviour-tests/steps/behaviour-bundle-steps.js`

CI Docker Playwright may handle Stripe overlays differently from local Mac. Changed to a fallback chain:
1. Standard click (waits for actionability, timeout 5s)
2. Force click (bypasses overlay checks, timeout 5s)
3. JS dispatch (evaluates `button.click()` directly in page context)

## CI Deploy Results

| Run | Commit | Result | Failure Point |
|-----|--------|--------|---------------|
| 22047106611 | pre-fix | Stripe redirect timeout | Submit click not registering |
| 22048476091 | `46010042` (force:true + initializeSalt) | Stripe redirect timeout | Click fires but Stripe doesn't process payment |
| 22048846843 | same | Stripe redirect timeout | Same |
| 22049185727 | `5bd1e961` (3s delay) | Stripe redirect timeout | Same — 3s delay didn't help |
| 22056727901 | `4ca33fbb` (multi-strategy) | **Cancelled** | `maven package` job cancelled (unknown reason) |
| 22056816885 | `4ca33fbb` (multi-strategy) | **Pending** | Deploy in progress (from-scratch rebuild, stacks were torn down by SelfDestructStack) |

## Proxy Test Results

All fixes pass proxy consistently:
- `force: true` only: **1 passed** (2.3m)
- Multi-strategy click: **1 passed** (5.4m)
- Multiple proxy runs confirmed: the Stripe checkout flow works end-to-end locally

## Current State (2026-02-16)

### What's committed and pushed (branch `nvsubhash`)
- `46010042` — force:true on submit + initializeSalt in webhook
- `5bd1e961` — 3s delay before Stripe submit
- `4ca33fbb` — multi-strategy click fallback chain

### What's pending
- **Deploy run 22056816885** is in progress (fresh deploy from scratch — all ci-nvsubhash stacks were torn down by SelfDestructStack inactivity timeout)
- Once deployed, paymentBehaviour-ci will run as part of the deploy workflow
- This will be the first CI test of the multi-strategy click approach

### Outstanding CI mystery
In CI Docker Playwright, even with `force: true`, the Stripe checkout submit click doesn't result in payment processing. The click appears to fire (no error thrown), but Stripe never redirects back. No webhook Lambda invocations occur during the test window, meaning Stripe's client-side JS doesn't process the payment.

Possible causes still to investigate:
1. **CI Docker Chrome headless** handles `MouseEvent` dispatching differently from Mac Chrome
2. **Stripe's SPA** may detect headless/automated browsers and block payment processing
3. **Network/CSP issue** in CI preventing Stripe's JS from communicating with its backend
4. The 403 error on initial page load (`Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403`) may indicate a broader issue
5. **Consider adding `page.keyboard.press('Enter')` after filling name field** as an alternative to clicking submit

### Next steps when resuming
1. Check result of deploy run 22056816885
2. If paymentBehaviour-ci still fails, examine CI screenshots from `target/behaviour-test-results/` artifacts
3. Try `page.keyboard.press('Enter')` approach as alternative to mouse click
4. Consider adding network request logging to capture what Stripe's JS is doing after submit
5. Consider checking if Stripe blocks automated browsers (look for bot detection in CI console logs)

## Files Changed

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `behaviour-tests/steps/behaviour-bundle-steps.js` | Multi-strategy submit click (standard → force → JS dispatch), 3s pre-submit delay, post-submit error detection + screenshot |
| `app/functions/billing/billingWebhookPost.js` | Added `import { initializeSalt }` and `await initializeSalt()` at start of `ingestHandler()` |

- [x] Fix implemented: multi-strategy click + error detection + post-submit screenshot
- [x] Proxy test verified locally: **PASSED** (multiple runs, consistently passes)
- [x] CI webhook root cause found and fixed: `billingWebhookPost.js` missing `initializeSalt()`
- [x] Proxy test re-verified after all fixes: **PASSED** (1 passed, 5.4m)
- [ ] **CI test awaiting deploy run 22056816885** (fresh deploy from scratch)
- [ ] If CI still fails: investigate CI Docker headless Chrome + Stripe interaction
