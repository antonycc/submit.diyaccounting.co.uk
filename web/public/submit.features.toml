# Feature flags for DIY Accounting Submit
#
# Each [[features]] entry defines a feature toggle:
#   id          - unique identifier (kebab-case)
#   name        - human-readable name
#   enabled     - whether the feature is active (true/false)
#   description - what the feature does
#
# Future A/B testing extensions:
#   rolloutPercent - percentage of users who see the feature (0-100)
#   variants       - array of variant objects for multivariate tests
#   audience       - targeting rules (e.g., by environment, user segment)
#
# The client-side evaluator (lib/feature-flags.js) fetches this file,
# caches it, and exposes a simple isFeatureEnabled(id) API.
