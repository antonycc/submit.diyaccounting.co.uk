      "answer": "The most common causes are:\n1. **Pop-up blocker** - HMRC authentication opens in a new window.

Ensure third-party cookies aren't blocked for tax.service.gov.uk\n3. **Session expired** - If you've been on the page a while, refresh and try again\n4. **HMRC service down** - Check https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hm-revenue-and-customs-service-availability-and-issues for outages\n",

      "answer": "Sandbox and production use different HMRC environments with separate credentials:\n- **Sandbox** uses test credentials (any VRN works)\n- **Production** requires your real HMRC Government Gateway login\n\nIf sandbox works but production doesn't:\n1. Ensure you're using your actual Government Gateway credentials (not test ones)\n2. Check your VRN is registered for MTD VAT with HMRC\n3. You may need to re-authorise if your HMRC permissions changed\n",
