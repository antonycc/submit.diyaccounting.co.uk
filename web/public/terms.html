        <h2>7. Fraud Prevention Headers</h2>
        <p>
          In compliance with HMRC Making Tax Digital (MTD) regulations, the Service collects and transmits fraud prevention headers with
          each VAT return submission. This is a <strong>legal requirement</strong> for all MTD-compliant software.
        </p>
        <p>Data collected includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Public IP address</li>
          <li>Device identifier (generated fresh for each submission, not stored persistently)</li>
          <li>Browser user agent, timezone, screen resolution, and window size</li>
          <li>User identifier (Cognito user ID)</li>
          <li>Vendor information (application name and version)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This data helps HMRC identify and prevent fraudulent VAT submissions and supports criminal prosecutions for tax fraud. You consent
          to this collection when you authorize the Service through HMRC's OAuth flow. For full details, see the
          <a href="./privacy.html#hmrc-fraud-prevention">HMRC Fraud Prevention section</a> of our Privacy Policy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>8. HMRC Software Vendor Status</h2>
        <p>
          DIY Accounting Submit is developed to comply with HMRC's Making Tax Digital for VAT requirements. The Service uses HMRC's official
          APIs and implements all required fraud prevention headers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Current status:</strong> The Service is fully functional with HMRC's sandbox (test) environment and has been tested
          against HMRC's fraud prevention header validation endpoint. Production credentials are being sought from HMRC.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are committed to maintaining compliance with all HMRC requirements for MTD software vendors, including ongoing fraud prevention
          header compliance and security standards.
