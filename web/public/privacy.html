          DIY Accounting Submit is a lightweight web application that helps you submit UK VAT returns. We aim to collect the minimum data
          necessary to operate the service and monitor performance.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Real User Monitoring (RUM) performance data (only after you consent): page load timing, Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS),
            JavaScript errors, and HTTP request timings from your browser to our API. This is provided by Amazon CloudWatch RUM.
          </li>
          <li>
            A pseudonymous user identifier for correlation. When you are logged in, we hash your user identifier in the browser and send
            only the hash to RUM. We do not send your raw identifier to RUM.
          </li>
          <li>
            Operational logs from our infrastructure (e.g., CloudFront/WAF request logs, API Gateway access logs), which contain request
            metadata such as timestamps, paths, response codes, and IP addresses as seen by our edge or origin services.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How and when we collect it</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>RUM only starts after you click “Accept” in the consent banner. Until then, no RUM data is sent.</li>
          <li>
            Infrastructure logs are collected automatically by AWS services when you use the site, for security and operational reasons.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What we use it for</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To monitor and improve site performance and reliability.</li>
          <li>To detect errors and troubleshoot issues.</li>
          <li>To protect the service and our users from abuse and attacks.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data retention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CloudWatch RUM retains events for 30 days by default. Aggregated dashboards may reflect anonymized trends.</li>
          <li>
            Other AWS logs (e.g., CloudFront, API access logs) have retention policies configured in our account and are generally kept for
            short operational periods unless required for security investigations.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Cookies and storage</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>RUM may use cookies/local storage to establish session information when you have consented.</li>
          <li>We store access tokens and minimal user info in your browser storage to enable login and API access.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Your choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can decline analytics in the consent banner. You can later change your choice by clearing site data in your browser and
            revisiting.
          </li>
          <li>If you revoke consent, RUM will not be initialized on future visits unless you consent again.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data processors</h2>
        <p>We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host and operate the website, API, and monitoring services.</p>
