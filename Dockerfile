# Optimized Dockerfile for AWS Lambda with ARM64 architecture
# Uses multi-stage build with cross-compilation:
#   - Builder stage runs on the build host's native arch (x86_64 on GitHub Actions)
#   - Final stage targets ARM64 for Lambda
# All production deps are pure JavaScript, so node_modules are architecture-portable.

# Builder stage: runs natively on the build host (no QEMU emulation)
# Uses node:22-slim instead of the Lambda image — only needs npm for dependency install.
FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM node:22-slim AS builder
