# Plan: API Gateway Custom Domain + Domain Convention Alignment + Fraud Prevention Fix

**Status: COMPLETE** — All items deployed to CI and prod as of 8 February 2026.

## Context

HMRC rejected our fraud prevention headers because `Gov-Client-Public-Port` was missing. To get the client's source port, we need CloudFront to forward the `CloudFront-Viewer-Address` header to API Gateway. The only CDK option is `OriginRequestHeaderBehavior.all("CloudFront-Viewer-Address")`, which forwards ALL viewer headers including `Host`. API Gateway rejects requests where the forwarded `Host` header doesn't match a configured custom domain, returning 403. This broke 10/17 CI behaviour tests.

The fix: configure API Gateway custom domains matching the `Host` headers CloudFront forwards. Concurrently, align submit's domain naming with gateway/spreadsheets conventions.

## Prerequisites (Manual — before any code deploy)

### P1. us-east-1 ACM certificates (3 total) — Done

**Keep existing cert `d340de40`** for EdgeStack + ApexStack. It already has the 6 SANs needed:
- `submit.diyaccounting.co.uk`, `*.submit.diyaccounting.co.uk`
- `ci-submit.diyaccounting.co.uk`, `prod-submit.diyaccounting.co.uk`
- `ci-holding.diyaccounting.co.uk`, `prod-holding.diyaccounting.co.uk`

No change to `certificateArn` in `cdk-application/cdk.json` or `cdk-environment/cdk.json`. Done.

**Create new auth cert** (us-east-1) for IdentityStack/Cognito custom domain:
- `ci-auth.diyaccounting.co.uk`
- `prod-auth.diyaccounting.co.uk`

Done: arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:887764105431:certificate/8750ac93-48f8-47fc-9702-8707d3b7398a

Add authCertificateArn to cdk-environment/cdk.json. Done.

**Create new simulator cert** (us-east-1) for SimulatorStack:
- `ci-simulator.diyaccounting.co.uk`
- `prod-simulator.diyaccounting.co.uk`

Done: arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:887764105431:certificate/5b8afa59-8e91-4335-9196-f4043c1870b3

Add simulatorCertificateArn to cdk-environment/cdk.json. Done.

### P2. eu-west-2 ACM certificate — Done

Cert `1f9c9a57-5834-41d3-822d-4aae7e32d633` already covers:
- `submit.diyaccounting.co.uk`, `*.submit.diyaccounting.co.uk`
- `ci-submit.diyaccounting.co.uk`, `prod-submit.diyaccounting.co.uk`

`regionalCertificateArn` in `cdk-application/cdk.json` already updated. Done.

### P3. Register new callback URLs in HMRC Developer Hub — Done

### P4. Register new redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console — Done

Google OAuth redirects to the Cognito domain. Since `cognitoDomainName` changed from `ci-auth.submit.diyaccounting.co.uk` to `ci-auth.diyaccounting.co.uk`, added:
- `https://ci-auth.diyaccounting.co.uk/oauth2/idpresponse`
- `https://prod-auth.diyaccounting.co.uk/oauth2/idpresponse`

## Code Changes

### C1. `SubmitSharedNames.java` — Domain name construction — Done

### C2. `.github/actions/get-names/action.yml` — Apex + holding domain computation — Done

### C3. `ApiStack.java` — Add API Gateway custom domain — Done

Also added cleanup Lambda for external API Gateway custom domain mappings on stack deletion (PR #677).

### C4. `SubmitApplication.java` — Wire regionalCertificateArn to ApiStack — Done

### C5. `EdgeStack.java` — No change needed — Done

The `all("CloudFront-Viewer-Address")` ORP stays. The 403 is fixed by API GW custom domains.

### C6. `SubmitEnvironment.java` — Wire separate auth/simulator cert ARNs — Done

### C7. `cdk-environment/cdk.json` — Add auth/simulator cert ARNs — Done

### C8. `.github/actions/set-origins/action.yml` — Add API GW custom domain transfer — Done

Also added:
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for both create and delete API GW domain operations (PR #679)
- Route53 DNS upsert for `prod-apex-alias` (`submit.diyaccounting.co.uk`) (PR #678)

### C9. `deploy.yml` — Pass new parameters to set-origins — Done

### C10. `.env.ci` and `.env.prod` — Update base URLs — Done

### C11. IdentityStack — Cognito domain change (destructive) — Done

### C12. Prod additional alias — `submit.diyaccounting.co.uk` — Done

   - deploy-root.yml: `diyaccounting.co.uk` and `www.diyaccounting.co.uk` now served by prod-gateway (E18ZQRDYBD8UCA)
   - deploy-holding (last-known-good): `submit.diyaccounting.co.uk` DNS and API GW custom domain fixed
