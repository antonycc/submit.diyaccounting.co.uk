## ðŸŽ¯ MVP (Initial Release)

### Features:

* Basic HTML form to submit VAT returns.
* No persistent identityâ€”OAuth performed per submission.
* Submission status and receipts stored securely in AWS S3.

### Tech Stack:

* **Frontend:** HTML5, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js), AWS Lambda
* **Infrastructure:** AWS CDK (Java), AWS S3, AWS SQS
* **Authentication:** HMRC OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant)

### âš¡ Step-by-step User Journey (Simplest VAT Submission)

### Step 1: Open Submission Page

* User opens the **submission webpage** you provide (your MVP site).
* Presented with a simple HTML form to input VAT details:

    * **VAT registration number** (VRN)
    * **Period Key** (the identifier for the VAT period they're submitting for)
    * **Total VAT Due**
    * (Other minimum fields depending on obligation)

---

### Step 2: User Completes the VAT Submission Form

User fills in the form fields, e.g.:

| Field                   | Example Input |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| VAT Registration Number | 123456789     |
| Period Key              | 24A1          |
| VAT Due                 | Â£2,400.00     |

Then clicks **Submit VAT Return**.

---

### Step 3: Redirect to HMRC for Authentication

Since no retained tokens exist, the system initiates a fresh HMRC OAuth flow:

* User is redirected automatically to HMRCâ€™s **OAuth consent screen**.
* URL example:

```
https://api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/oauth/authorize
  ?response_type=code
  &client_id=YOUR_HMRC_CLIENT_ID
  &redirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/callback
  &scope=write:vat+read:vat
  &state=randomly-generated-string
```

---

### Step 4: User Logs in at HMRC (Government Gateway)

User sees HMRC's official login screen:

* User enters their HMRC **Government Gateway ID and password**.
* HMRC prompts user to **consent** to allow your app to submit VAT returns.

---

### Step 5: HMRC Redirects Back to Your App with an Auth Code

After login and consent, HMRC sends the user back to your app at your configured `redirect_uri`:

* Example redirect:

```
https://yourapp.com/callback?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&state=randomly-generated-string
```

* Your app verifies the state matches the one sent initially.

---

### Step 6: Your App Exchanges Auth Code for Access Token

Your backend makes a server-to-server request (user sees nothing):

* Request:

```http
POST https://api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/oauth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&
client_id=YOUR_HMRC_CLIENT_ID&
client_secret=YOUR_HMRC_SECRET&
redirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/callback&
code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE
```

* Response (example):

```json
{
  "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN",
  "refresh_token": "REFRESH_TOKEN",
  "expires_in": 14400,
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "scope": "write:vat read:vat"
}
```

> You won't retain tokens here, as per your MVP scenario.

---

### Step 7: Your App Calls HMRC VAT API to Retrieve Obligations (optional but recommended)

Typically, first, confirm the period you're submitting for is correct:

* GET obligations:

```http
GET https://api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/organisations/vat/123456789/obligations
Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
```

This confirms available periods, and statuses, e.g.:

```json
{
  "obligations": [
    {
      "start": "2025-01-01",
      "end": "2025-03-31",
      "due": "2025-05-07",
      "status": "O",
      "periodKey": "24A1"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Step 8: Submit VAT Return to HMRC via API

Use the data from the form to POST to HMRC's API:

* POST VAT return:

```http
POST https://api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/organisations/vat/123456789/returns
Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "periodKey": "24A1",
  "vatDueSales": 2400.00,
  "vatDueAcquisitions": 0.00,
  "totalVatDue": 2400.00,
  "vatReclaimedCurrPeriod": 0.00,
  "netVatDue": 2400.00,
  "totalValueSalesExVAT": 12000.00,
  "totalValuePurchasesExVAT": 0.00,
  "totalValueGoodsSuppliedExVAT": 0.00,
  "totalAcquisitionsExVAT": 0.00,
  "finalised": true
}
```

* HMRC Response (success example):

```json
{
  "processingDate": "2025-07-14T20:20:20Z",
  "paymentIndicator": "BANK",
  "formBundleNumber": "123456789012",
  "chargeRefNumber": "XZ1234567890"
}
```

---

### Step 9: Display Submission Result to User

Your app shows the result clearly:

* Confirmation page with **Processing date**, **Form Bundle Number**, and **Charge Ref**.

Example:

```
âœ… VAT Return Submitted Successfully!

Date processed: 14 July 2025
Form bundle number: 123456789012
Charge reference: XZ1234567890
```

---

### Step 10: (Optional) Log the Submission Receipt

* Store a copy of the submission receipt securely (e.g., AWS S3 bucket), providing user with a link to view/download the official HMRC acknowledgment.
