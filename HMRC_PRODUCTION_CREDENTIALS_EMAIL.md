## Testing Completed

We have completed testing in the sandbox environment using the Create Test User API and Test Fraud Prevention Headers API.

**Test evidence is available at:**
https://submit.diyaccounting.co.uk/tests/test-report-template.html?test=web-test

## Fraud Prevention Headers

Our fraud prevention headers have been validated against specVersion 3.3 of the Test Fraud Prevention Headers API. Two items require explanation:

### 1. gov-client-public-port (Error - MISSING_HEADER)

Our application uses AWS CloudFront CDN. The client's source port is not preserved through the CloudFront edge network, making this header impossible to collect reliably.

### 2. gov-vendor-license-ids (Warning - MISSING_HEADER)

Not applicable. This is open source software and we do not issue license keys to users.

### Headers Sent Correctly

All other mandatory headers are sent correctly:

| Header | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Gov-Client-Connection-Method | `WEB_APP_VIA_SERVER` |
| Gov-Client-Public-IP | Extracted from CloudFront X-Forwarded-For |
| Gov-Client-Device-ID | HMAC-SHA256 hashed user identifier |
| Gov-Client-Timezone | JavaScript Intl API |
| Gov-Client-Screens | JavaScript screen properties |
| Gov-Client-Window-Size | JavaScript window dimensions |
| Gov-Client-Browser-JS-User-Agent | JavaScript navigator.userAgent |
| Gov-Client-Multi-Factor | MFA metadata from Google federation |
| Gov-Vendor-Version | Software version from package.json |
| Gov-Vendor-Product-Name | `web-submit-diyaccounting-co-uk` |
| Gov-Vendor-Public-IP | Server public IP |
| Gov-Vendor-Forwarded | Proxy chain information |
