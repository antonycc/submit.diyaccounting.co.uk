I have just completed phase 1 of `scale-to-zero-ready-hot.md`, I'm skipping phase 2 because I don't want to use a config file now that the provisioned concurrency values are in the lambda version aliases. Please adapt `.github/workflows/scale-to.yml` to work with the new aliases based on phase 3 of `scale-to-zero-ready-hot.md` with the difference that instead of using `lambda-concurrency-config.yaml` the composite action `.github/actions/scale-lambda-concurrency/action.yml` must query all AWS lambdas in the account which have the value of `${{ inputs.deployment-name }}` as the prefix for that lambda function name. Also thoroughly review and update REPOSITORY_DOCUMENTATION.md to match the lambda async behaviour, which lambdas are configured in what sync/async style and how the scale-to workflow is used to set a named concurrency.
