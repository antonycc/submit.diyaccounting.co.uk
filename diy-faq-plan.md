# DIY Accounting Submit - FAQ & Support System Implementation Plan

## Overview

Add a FAQ/Help system to https://submit.diyaccounting.co.uk with:
1. A new `/help` page with searchable FAQs
2. Fuzzy-matching search that filters FAQs as user types
3. Support ticket submission via GitHub Issues (two paths: direct link or authenticated Lambda)

The site is a static SPA hosted on S3/CloudFront, using Cognito for auth and raw ES modules (no framework). FAQs are loaded from a TOML file at build time and indexed client-side.

3. **Session expired** — If you've been on the page a while, refresh and try again
4. **HMRC service down** — Check https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hm-revenue-and-customs-service-availability-and-issues for outages

Sandbox and production use different HMRC environments with separate credentials:
- **Sandbox** uses test credentials (any VAT registration number works)

If sandbox works but production doesn't:
1. Ensure you're using your actual Government Gateway credentials (not test ones)

answer = """
A bundle is a saved configuration for a VAT submission. It stores:
- Your VAT registration number
- Whether to use sandbox or production HMRC
- Your HMRC authorisation

You can have multiple bundles if you submit VAT for multiple businesses. Each bundle is independent — authorising one doesn't affect others.

1. Go to **View and edit your bundles**

## Part 2: FAQ Page UI

### File: `src/pages/help.html`

Create a new page accessible from the hamburger menu. Design should match existing site style (blue headers, white cards, clean layout).

```html

### Styling notes (match existing site)

- Primary blue: `#2b579a` (from existing buttons)
- Background: `#f5f5f5`
- Card background: white with subtle shadow
- Font: system font stack (already in use)
- FAQ items: collapsible accordion style, one open at a time
- Search box: full width, prominent, same border radius as existing inputs

## Part 4: Build Step — TOML to JSON

### Add to build process

Use a simple Node script or integrate into existing build:

```javascript
// scripts/build-faqs.js
import { parse } from 'smol-toml'; // or @iarna/toml
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync } from 'fs';

const toml = readFileSync('src/data/faqs.toml', 'utf-8');
const data = parse(toml);
writeFileSync('src/data/faqs.json', JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
console.log(`Built ${data.faq.length} FAQs`);
```

Add to package.json scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:faqs": "node scripts/build-faqs.js",
    "build": "npm run build:faqs && <existing build>"
  }
}
```

Dev dependency: `npm install --save-dev smol-toml`

---

## Part 5: Support Ticket Lambda

### Architecture

```
User (authenticated via Cognito)
    ↓
API Gateway (with Cognito authorizer)
    ↓
Lambda: create-support-issue
    ↓
GitHub API → Creates issue in repo
```

### CDK Stack Addition

Add to existing CDK stack (or create `lib/support-stack.ts`):

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';
import * as apigateway from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigateway';
import * as secretsmanager from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-secretsmanager';
import { NodejsFunction } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs';

interface SupportStackProps extends cdk.StackProps {
  userPool: cdk.aws_cognito.IUserPool;
  githubTokenSecretArn: string;
  githubRepo: string; // e.g. "owner/repo"
}

export class SupportStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props: SupportStackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Reference existing secret containing GitHub PAT
    const githubSecret = secretsmanager.Secret.fromSecretCompleteArn(
      this, 'GitHubToken', props.githubTokenSecretArn
    );

    // Lambda to create GitHub issues
    const createIssueFn = new NodejsFunction(this, 'CreateSupportIssue', {
      entry: 'lambda/create-support-issue/index.ts',
      handler: 'handler',
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_20_X,
      timeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(10),
      environment: {
        GITHUB_SECRET_ARN: props.githubTokenSecretArn,
        GITHUB_REPO: props.githubRepo,
      },
    });

    // Grant Lambda access to read the secret
    githubSecret.grantRead(createIssueFn);

    // API Gateway with Cognito authorizer
    const api = new apigateway.RestApi(this, 'SupportApi', {
      restApiName: 'DIY Support API',
      defaultCorsPreflightOptions: {
        allowOrigins: ['https://submit.diyaccounting.co.uk'],
        allowMethods: ['POST', 'OPTIONS'],
        allowHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
      },
    });

    const authorizer = new apigateway.CognitoUserPoolsAuthorizer(this, 'SupportAuthorizer', {
      cognitoUserPools: [props.userPool],
    });

    const supportResource = api.root.addResource('support');
    supportResource.addMethod('POST', new apigateway.LambdaIntegration(createIssueFn), {
      authorizer,
      authorizationType: apigateway.AuthorizationType.COGNITO,
    });

    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'SupportApiUrl', {
      value: api.url,
    });
  }
}
```

### Lambda Implementation

#### File: `lambda/create-support-issue/index.ts`

```typescript
import { APIGatewayProxyHandler } from 'aws-lambda';
import { SecretsManager } from '@aws-sdk/client-secrets-manager';

const secretsManager = new SecretsManager({});

interface SupportRequest {
  subject: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
}

interface GitHubIssueResponse {
  number: number;
  html_url: string;
}

export const handler: APIGatewayProxyHandler = async (event) => {
  // CORS headers
  const headers = {
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://submit.diyaccounting.co.uk',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type,Authorization',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  };

  try {
    // Parse and validate request
    if (!event.body) {
      return { statusCode: 400, headers, body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Missing body' }) };
    }

    const { subject, description, category } = JSON.parse(event.body) as SupportRequest;

    if (!subject || !description || !category) {
      return { statusCode: 400, headers, body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Missing required fields' }) };
    }

    // Get user info from Cognito claims
    const claims = event.requestContext.authorizer?.claims;
    const userEmail = claims?.email || 'unknown';
    const userId = claims?.sub || 'unknown';

    // Get GitHub token from Secrets Manager
    const secretResponse = await secretsManager.getSecretValue({
      SecretId: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET_ARN,
    });
    const githubToken = secretResponse.SecretString;

    // Create GitHub issue
    const issueBody = `
## Support Request

**Category:** ${category}
**User:** ${userEmail} (${userId})
**Submitted:** ${new Date().toISOString()}

---

${description}

---
*Submitted via DIY Accounting Submit support form*
    `.trim();

    const categoryLabels: Record<string, string> = {
      connection: 'connection',
      submission: 'submission',
      bundles: 'bundles',
      receipts: 'receipts',
      other: 'general',
    };

    const response = await fetch(
      `https://api.github.com/repos/${process.env.GITHUB_REPO}/issues`,
      {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${githubToken}`,
          Accept: 'application/vnd.github+json',
          'X-GitHub-Api-Version': '2022-11-28',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          title: `[Support] ${subject}`,
          body: issueBody,
          labels: ['support', categoryLabels[category] || 'general'],
        }),
      }
    );

    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorText = await response.text();
      console.error('GitHub API error:', response.status, errorText);
      return {
        statusCode: 502,
        headers,
        body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Failed to create issue' }),
      };
    }

    const issue: GitHubIssueResponse = await response.json();

    return {
      statusCode: 201,
      headers,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        success: true,
        issueNumber: issue.number,
        issueUrl: issue.html_url,
      }),
    };
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error:', err);
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      headers,
      body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Internal server error' }),
    };
  }
};
```

### Client-side API Call

#### File: `src/js/support-api.js`

```javascript
/**
 * Support API client
 */

const SUPPORT_API_URL = 'https://[API_GATEWAY_URL]/support'; // Replace after deployment

export async function submitSupportTicket({ subject, description, category }) {
  // Get current Cognito session token
  const session = await getCurrentSession(); // Use your existing auth helper
  const token = session.getIdToken().getJwtToken();
  
  const response = await fetch(SUPPORT_API_URL, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': token,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ subject, description, category }),
  });
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    const error = await response.json();
    throw new Error(error.error || 'Failed to submit');
  }
  
  return response.json();
}
```

---

## Part 6: GitHub Setup

### Create Issue Template

File: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/support.md`

```markdown
---
name: Support Request
about: Get help with DIY Accounting Submit
title: '[Support] '
labels: support
assignees: ''
---

**Category**
<!-- connection / submission / bundles / receipts / other -->

**Description**
<!-- Describe your issue clearly -->

**Steps to reproduce (if applicable)**
1. 
2. 
3. 

**Expected behaviour**


**Screenshots (if applicable)**


**Browser/Device**
<!-- e.g. Chrome 120 on Windows 11 -->
```

### Create Labels

Ensure these labels exist in the repo:
- `support` (for all support issues)
- `connection`
- `submission`
- `bundles`
- `receipts`
- `general`

### GitHub Personal Access Token

Create a fine-grained PAT with:
- Repository access: Only select the support repo
- Permissions: Issues (read/write)

Store in AWS Secrets Manager:
```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name diy-accounting/github-token \
  --secret-string "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

---

## Part 7: Navigation Integration

Add to hamburger menu (existing navigation):

```javascript
// In your menu configuration
{
  label: 'Help',
  href: '/help',
  icon: 'help-circle' // or appropriate icon
}
```

---

## Part 8: CSS Additions

## Notes for Claude Code

1. **Existing patterns**: Match the existing site's code style — vanilla JS with ES modules, no framework, existing CSS variables
2. **Auth integration**: The site already uses Cognito — reuse the existing session handling for the authenticated API call
3. **Build process**: Integrate TOML parsing into whatever build exists (may be simple file copy to S3)
4. **Error handling**: Be graceful — if the Lambda fails, the direct GitHub link is the fallback
5. **Mobile**: Ensure the modal and search work well on mobile (test at 375px width)
